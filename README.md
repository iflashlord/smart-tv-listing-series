#### Local and Remote Data

Inside `service/DataService.js` we have a variable `_isLocalDebug` that help you to switch either offline or online data. when `_isLocalDebug` is false we use a proxy to request the real server without CROS limitation, you should test in this state only on `localhost` by `npm start` command.
